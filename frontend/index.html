      CSP is delivered via Vercel route-specific headers. A meta tag would be
      applied to every route and combine with those headers, which previously
      caused the /sim-frame iframe to inherit the main app's strict policy and
      treat injected scripts as coming from about:srcdoc. Removing the meta tag
      lets the relaxed CSP for /sim-frame take effect while keeping the rest of
      the app locked down by headers alone.
